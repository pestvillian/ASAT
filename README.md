**Automated Sample Agitation Transportation System**

We are an Electrical Engineering Capstone group from the University of California, Santa Cruz. Our project aims to redesign an existing blood testing machine 
for our sponsor Gamze Onuker.

There are five folders for each group member, specifically Greg and Dorjee have written embedded code for the touchscreen and controlling the motors.

In addition, there is a "Motor Controller PCB" folder where Dorjee, Mishari and Alex designed a custom PCB to control all three stepper motors using an ESP32-C6-Mini and
power all components through an SMPS and buck regulator.
