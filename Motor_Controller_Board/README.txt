List of changes to track progress.

4/17/25 9:55pm. Added TMC2226 stepper driver to schematic and followed the datasheet. left questions in the schematic. main concerns are vmotor filtering, do we need diagnostic pins like pdn_uart, diag and index, and what vsense resistors do we use? there are other smaller questions too. -Dorjee
