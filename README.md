**Automated Sample Agitation Transportation System**

We are an Electrical Engineering Capstone group from the University of California, Santa Cruz. Our project aims to design a more efficient, more cost-effective solution for medical staff and researchers to process human samples for imaging. 

Here is an overview of the file structure:
  - Five folders for each group member
  - "Motor-Controller-Board" contains PCB files for the Motor Controller PCB
  - "Touchscreen-Hardware" contains PCB files for the two revisions of the touchscreen PCB
  - "Firmware" contains the firmware for both PCBs


Finally, we created a poster to visually explain our project!
