**Automated Sample Agitation Transportation System**

We are an Electrical Engineering Capstone group from the University of California, Santa Cruz. Our project aims to design a more efficient, more cost-effective solution for medical staff and researchers to process human samples for imaging. 

Here is an overview of the file structure:
  -Five folders for each group member
  -"Motor-Controller-Firmware" Firmware files for the motor controller motherboard and touchscreen daughterboard
  -"Motor-Controller-Board" contains PCB files for the Motor Controller PCB
  -"motor_tests" has test scripts for controlling the motors

Finally, we created a poster to visually explain our project!
